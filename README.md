# 12 Weeks Of NLP Learning
This repo is to keep track of my learnings that I plan on doing for 12 weeks to study **Natural Language Processing (NLP).**
I will be going thru and updating this on weekly basis. Updates will be pushed either *Fridays or Weekends*.

## Week Three of #12WeeksOfNLPLearning
I took a break in-between because of my current work transition. Getting back to my journey of learning NLP.
1. Completed Chapters 1 and 2 of the book: [Practical Natural Language Processing](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-natural-language/9781492054047/) 

2. When we don't have enough data- how to synthesize meaningful data for training- Some data augmentation techniques are: 
 - Synonym Replacement: Randomly chose 'K' words in sentence (make sure they are not stop words), and replace them with synonyms. 
 - Back Translation: Translate the sentences into different language and translate back to the English. 
 - Entities replacement: Replace the entities like name of person, location, organization etc with other entities but from same category.
